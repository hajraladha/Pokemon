Pokemon List

This is a pokemon app I did for my Achievement 1 of the CareerFoundry Course, with every pokemon from Gen 1.

● View a list of pokemons

● allow user to search for individual pokemon in search bar

● allow user to see name and image of pokemon in list

● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a pokemon), view details for that pokemon

● allow user to see name, height and weight of selected pokemon in a modal
